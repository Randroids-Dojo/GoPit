Improve visibility and feel of game elements to match mobile best practices and align with Ball x Pit proportions.

## Problem
- Player too small (5.6% of screen width, should be ~10%)
- Gems nearly invisible (2.2%, should be ~4%)
- Health bar too thin to read at a glance
- TopBar cramped at 50px height
- Enemies same size as player (should feel more threatening)

## Reference
- Ball x Pit uses larger, more visible game elements
- Mobile roguelites typically use 8-12% screen width for player character

## Success Criteria
- Player clearly visible and feels substantial
- Gems easy to spot and satisfying to collect
- Health bar readable at a glance
- Overall game feels more polished and professional
