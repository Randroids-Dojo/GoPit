# Code Review Cleanup

## Overview
Address code quality issues, bugs, and refactoring opportunities identified during code reviews.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All identified bugs fixed
- [ ] Code follows project patterns consistently
- [ ] Hardcoded paths replaced with groups where appropriate
- [ ] All tests passing

## Child Tasks
1. ~~GoPit-iqz - Fix void ball alternation state bug (high priority)~~ **CLOSED**
2. GoPit-fmp - Consolidate hardcoded scene paths to use groups (low priority) - **OPEN**

**NOTE (2026-01-19)**: Only GoPit-fmp remains. When that is closed, this EPIC can be closed.

## Notes
This epic tracks technical debt and code quality improvements that don't add new features but improve maintainability and correctness.
