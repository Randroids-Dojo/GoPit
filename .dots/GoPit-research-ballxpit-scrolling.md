## Research Questions

Clarify exactly how BallxPit's core mechanics work to ensure accurate comparison with GoPit.

### Confirmed (from web research)

1. **Screen scrolls upward** - "the screen continuously scrolls upward"
2. **Stages scroll at set pace** - auto-scrolling, not player-controlled
3. **Player at bottom of screen** - "little dude at the bottom of your screen"
4. **Enemies descend** - "waves of enemies coming down towards you"
5. **Gems don't auto-collect** - "XP crystals don't auto-collect, so you need to actively pick them up"
6. **Every enemy drops a gem** - "every enemy leaves a gem which gives you experience"
7. **Enemies attack at bottom** - "When enemies reach the bottom, they launch an attack and then die"

### Needs Verification (play the game or find video proof)

- [ ] **Q1: Do gems scroll with the world or stay screen-relative?**
  - If world-relative: gems scroll off bottom = lost
  - If screen-relative: gems stay until despawn timer

- [ ] **Q2: Is there a gem despawn timer?**
  - Some games use both scrolling AND timer
  - Does gem blink/fade before disappearing?

- [ ] **Q3: How fast does the screen scroll?**
  - Slow enough to backtrack for gems?
  - Does scroll speed increase with difficulty (Fast+N)?

- [ ] **Q4: What is the base gem pickup radius?**
  - How close must player be without Magnet passive?
  - Is it tile-based or pixel-based?

- [ ] **Q5: Player vertical movement range?**
  - Can player go to top of screen?
  - Or confined to lower portion?

### Research Methods

1. **Watch gameplay videos** on YouTube - look for gem behavior
2. **Play the demo** - https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651790/BALL_x_PIT_Demo/
3. **Check Steam community** for mechanic discussions
4. **Review wiki/guides** for precise numbers
