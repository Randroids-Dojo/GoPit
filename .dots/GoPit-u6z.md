# Code Review Cleanup

## Overview
Address code quality issues, bugs, and refactoring opportunities identified during code reviews.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All identified bugs fixed
- [ ] Code follows project patterns consistently
- [ ] Hardcoded paths replaced with groups where appropriate
- [ ] All tests passing

## Child Tasks
1. GoPit-iqz - Fix void ball alternation state bug (high priority)
2. GoPit-fmp - Consolidate hardcoded scene paths to use groups (low priority)

## Notes
This epic tracks technical debt and code quality improvements that don't add new features but improve maintainability and correctness.
