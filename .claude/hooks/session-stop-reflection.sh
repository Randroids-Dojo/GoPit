SESSION REFLECTION PROMPT:

Before ending, consider: Would any AGENTS.md changes help the next agent avoid issues you encountered in this session?

If yes, propose updates covering:
- Tools or commands that were hard to find
- Workflows that weren't obvious
- Gotchas or platform-specific limitations
- Best practices you discovered
