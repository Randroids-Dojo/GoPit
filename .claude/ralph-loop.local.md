Start or continue comparing every aspect of our current game design and implemention to the real BallxPit game. Pay special attention to core mechanics like shooting balls, enemy placement, level speed, fission vs fusion vs upgrade, level select, difficulty / speed for different level iterations, the progression system, etc. Continually document differences as you find them. Use beads to track what you have analyzed and what remains. DO NOT change any code except to help test and identify more details about the current state of things. YOUR CORE MISSION is to discover and document how our game works compared to BallxPit and how we might change it to be more aligned.
