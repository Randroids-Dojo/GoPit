Systematically work through our beads backlog. Making sure to research tasks and plan before implementing. ALWAYS use PlayGadot to test your implementations. If new issues are found during development, track as new beads items. Keep beads organized and up-to-date. Close tasks when they are verified as done. Open new tasks if there is follow-up work. Commit all changes to main and monitor CI jobs for successful deployments. Be smart, idiomatic, creative, and stick as close to the BallxPit gameplay as we can. If you ever get stuck, rollback and try again.
